            A common problem among the elder citizens are fall induced injuries.
            This problem is even worse if the elderly is alone, and cannot call
            for help.

            This is why a locally connected camera maybe used to detect falls.
            It can notify a family member or caregiver of the incident, and
            start a videocall right away.

            However, cameras are intrusive devices, and many people don't feel comfortable having them around.
			This is why we introduce this brand new technology: pose estimation via RF signals. With this technology, we can detect
			a fall without the use of cameras. Just place a couple of this cutes trascienvers around the room and you are all set.

            Another big problem with the elderly are fire and gas related incidents. It's really easy to forget the oven on, 
			or to just not close enough the gas valve. Also, if a gas heating system is used, a CO2 detector becomes vital.

            Many of this systems already exist, but non of the are easy to use for an elderly person. That's why a simple an intuitive voice-activated 
			control panel is used. It enables the connection of all aforementioned sensors, and makes it really simple for someone to interact with 
			new technologies. It can send text messeges via voice, and read them aloud, and also remind you to take vital medication, and drink water.
			It can also do other stuff, like start a video call, or call emergency services when someone yells for help.
