              10% of Argentina's overall population is over the age of 65, an
              age group prone to domestic accidents. Furthermore, 1/5 of them
              lives alone. In Argentina, 1/3 senior citizens falls during a
              year, with half of them doing so more than once. Around 50% of
              falls in the elderly result in bone fractures.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another very important source of injury is fire and gas-related
              incidents. Who hasn’t heard of a stove left on? Or a gas heater
              consuming all the oxygen? In Buenos Aires, Argentina’s capital,
              over 80% of intoxications are related to malfunctioning or misused
              gas appliances. This problem becomes more severe with age, due to
              the natural memory loss in elderly people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Something else that can easily be observed whilst engaging with an
              older person is the difficulty they have using a modern device,
              like a smartphone or a tablet. There is no easy way for them to
              get a grasp of all the technologies available to the younger
              generations. This usually leads to frustration and alienation, and
              sometimes even some form of recrimination by their children,
              related to not picking up the phone, or misconfiguring it.

              This is why we present <i>A.B.U.</i>, an innovative system, that
              merges several well-known technologies, alongside cutting-edge
              innovations, to provide a simple, intuitive, and yet very
              effective solution to all the above-mentioned problems. This
              system is designed in a way that the elderly population feels
              comfortable using, and that enhances their life quality.

              What you see on your right is the base unit. It is a wall-mounted
              or desk-placed device, with a screen with big readable fonts and a
              simple UI, a strong speaker, and omnidirectional microphones. The
              device provides simple voice-activated services, like current
              “smart home” devices, but with extra features tailored to the
              elderly generations, like advanced emergency calls and fall alerts
              to an emergency contact or first responders, and some daily
              activities helpers, like weather warnings and medication
              reminders.

            Another component of the system are fall detection cameras: simple
            and cheap cameras, placed in rooms of interest, in order to detect
            falls. These cameras have no connection to the Internet, just to the
            base unit, and their only task is to perform the optical detection
            of a fall. No recording is necessary, all processing is done on the
            fly.

              We also have fall detection RF sensors: inexpensive sensors that
              talk to the base unit, used to detect a fall, based on RF signals,
              with no optical detection, providing enhanced privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Optional smart wearable device can be connected to the base unit,
              should the elderly wish to do so, to monitor vital signs and log
              useful information.

            Having in mind the dangers of gas based devices, we also propose smoke, gas, CO, and CO2 sensors: small sensors used to
            detect hazardous situations, placed in critical spots around the house. They will communicate with the base unit and emit alerts as needed.
